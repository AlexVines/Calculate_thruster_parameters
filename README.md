# Calculate hall thruster parameters

## Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.7 

**Packages:** tkinter, scipy, math

### In spacecraft propulsion, a Hall-effect thruster is a type of ion thruster in which the propellant is accelerated by an electric field. Hall-effect thrusters use a magnetic field to limit the electrons' axial motion and then use them to ionize propellant, efficiently accelerate the ions to produce thrust, and neutralize the ions in the plume.
 
### Using this app you can calculate all necessary parameters by giving desired thrust and power. 
### Also you can get a magnetic parameters to help you to pick configuration for your coils.
